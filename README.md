# genetic-algorithm-neural-network-pytorch
Implementation for Genetic algorithm with neural network in Pytorch.

# Abstract classes
- `genetic_algorithm.py`: Abstract class for genetic algorithm.
- `genetic_algorithm_neural_network.py`: Abstract class for genetic algorithm 
with neural networks.

# Xor calculation
- A simple example for genetic algorithm neural network to 
calculate XOR operation.
- To run: `python -m xor_calculation.xor_ga_nn`

# Dino bot
- A bot to play Chrome Dino game with genetic algorithm neural network.
- To play the Dino game by yourself: `python -m dino.dino`
- To train the bot:  
`python -m dino.dino_ga_nn`
- To test the trained model: `python -m dino.test_weights`
